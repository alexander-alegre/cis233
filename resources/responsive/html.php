  <p class="text-danger">Some of these resources can also be used for other languages not just this one. I used these particular resources because they are the ones I have used myself.</p>

      <p>In my opinion HTML can be learned in a weekend if you spend several hours and work hard. There are different types of learners so my advice will be different for different people. In my opinion the best way to learn programming is by doing it. If you see a tutorial it will not stick with you. You actually have to follow along and build something.</p>
      <p>HTML is a small piece fo the puzzle but it is required even if you want to be a back end developer. Don't try to master HTML just learn the basics and the rest will come to you once you actually need it. Also don't make the mistake I made. I used to think if i Googled someting I didnt know how to program or I was a bad programmer. but I lerned that even the senior developers rely on Google when they get stuck.</p>

        <p>First thing i would recommend you follow along the W3 Schools tutorial for HTML. Take the test (the free one!) before you do it and then take the test after the tutorial and see if you improve.</p>

        <img src="../../resources/images/responsive/step2.png" alt="step 2 image">
        <p>Doing soemthing one time is not enough. Like anything in life, practice makes perfect. So after you are done with W3 Schools i would move on to some more advanced tutorials like the ones found on Udemy.</p>

        <p>Finally once you have a good understanding of HTML, i would recommend you sign up for treehouse. It's $25 a month but it's totally worth it! A lot of people glow over their in-browser text editor but i dont like it. I would say use your own text editor and local files that way you get a real world experience. Also Treehouse has the best structure for begginers and now after actually learning some HTML it will make better sense and therefore it will stick. Now let's make your website pleasing to lookg at with <a href="css.php">CSS</a>.</p>
