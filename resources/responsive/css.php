      <p>CSS is another one that is required to know. This one is quite easy to learn but very hard to master. You will most likely learn CSS along side with HTML. They go hand by hand.</p>
      <p>CSS is extremely hard to master because now with modern CSS you have so many more options and features you can do for things that before you needed JavaScript to accomplish. So needless to say CSS has come a very long way from changing the color of text to making some very cool animations. But this one you only need to learn the basics to start out.</p>

        <p>W3 Schools has a great tutorial on CSS and os very beginner friendly. I would recommend you start there and take their test before and after you do the tutorials. Also don't think that you're done because you finished the tutorial there is nothing wrong with doing it a second or even third time. It will only make you better.</p>

        <p>Now that you have some CSS and HTML under your belt I would say the next step is to build a very basic website! Yes we are doing some real work now! If you don;t have any ideas you can always ask a friend to be your "project manager" and give you a task and have them grade your work after and give you their thoughts.</p>

        <p>Now that you've figured out that writing hundreds of lines of CSS can get messy really wuick and it becomes hard to debug. The next step is to learn a framework/ibrary such as <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a> or <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/" target="_blank">Foundation</a>. I prefer Bootstrap just because they have great documentation but once you learn one the rest will be easier to learn. At this point you can make a really awesome looking site! Now lets add some behaviour with <a href="js.php">JavaScript!</a></p>
